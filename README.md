# Hey, I'm Nana Adjei

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently on a placement year at **MarineAI**, where I work on backend libraries, sensor interfaces, and more in **Python** and **C++**.

Outside of work, I'm a final-year **Software Engineering** student at the University of Portsmouth (returning in 2025). I'm especially interested in **robotics** and **artificial intelligence**, and while I haven’t launched any major AI/robotics projects *yet*, I’m actively working toward it — both in code and amount of Monster cans.

## My Tech Stack

- **Primary Languages**: Python, C++, JavaScript
- **Currently Learning**: React, TypeScript
- **Tools I Rely On**: Docker, Git (and lets be honest, sometimes Claude / ChatGPT)
- **Special Interests**: Systems programming, low-latency data pipelines, showing code to friends without it crashing — *then and only then*

## Personal Projects & Experiments

You’ll find all sorts here — some polished, most half-baked university projects. GitHub is my lab for ideas, libraries, and cursed experiments.

One of my proudest side quests:  
[**sneakyofficial.com**](http://sneakyofficial.com) – My personal site (and splatdle), hosted on my own servers (because why not make life harder and learn networking the hard way?).  
>  Might be down or wonky at times - it’s 20% portfolio, 80% chaos lab.

I also take commissions for **Discord bots** and **websites**, this is something I have done before with great satisfaction from my clients — DM me if interested, or even for me to give examples of projects I've worked on for clients.

## Work @ MarineAI

At MarineAI, I get to build real-world systems that support **autonomous marine navigation** and **safety-critical applications**. It’s fast-paced, hardware-integrated, and honestly a fantastic place to learn what “production-ready” *really* means.

## Side Involvements
I’m part of the dev team behind **Private 6 Mans**, a competitive Rocket League discord bot.  
I contribute backend features, commands, and Discord bot logic a lttle.
---

## Goals

- Specialise in **Robotics & AI** (catch me in 2026 building bots that judge your variable names)
- Keep exploring **embedded systems** and **distributed backends**
- Build open-source tools that blend low-level power with clean high-level APIs
- Master containerisation workflows and infrastructure beyond just dev setups
